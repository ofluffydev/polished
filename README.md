**Polished OS** is an experimental operating system built to be accessible, modern, and more than just a personal project. It aims to eventually support `libc` and POSIX standards, making it suitable for general-purpose use.

At its core, Polished is designed as an *oskit-style* library: a modular Rust foundation for building applications or system software that can be reused or replaced with ease. **Polished OS** serves as both a demonstration and testbed for this library, showcasing its capabilities in constructing a full operating system while adhering to modern Rust idioms for safety, performance, and maintainability.

The primary copy of polished is now on codeberg, this repo is unlikely to be updated and may be removed in the future.
